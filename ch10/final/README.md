# CS 110 Final Exam

# Description: Goal of this project is to have a random emoji generated in the category of animals and nature and use this result to generate a poem with this item in the title 

# Known bugs or incomplete parts: I attempted to connect the two, but had some difficulty. The poetry section has not worked successfully, as the string returned from the emoji section did not successfully transfer to the title
